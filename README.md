A Logseq plugin to reset a managed sidebar.

![Screencast](./screencast.gif)

Logseq's sidebar is a dynamic region, sometimes you want to keep some pages or blocks always shown on top and in specific order. This plugin can help you do this.

It provides you five lists (I hope it's enough for you), you can choose to use one of them.

## Known issue

For now it can not clear those non-used panes, but you can use shortcut: double `cmd+c` to clear sidebar first, then click the reset sidebar toolbar icon.
